## Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently building [FlixTube](https://github.com/JayKay24/flix-tube), a video-streaming microservices application. Inspired by [Boostrapping Microservices](https://github.com/bootstrapping-microservices-2nd-edition).
- 🌱 FlixTube leverages the following technologies:
  * Terraform
  * TypeScript
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting distributed systems applications.
- 💬 Ask me about ...
